# panara_perception
Python code for interpreting AXB speech perception experiment data from two languages and ID data from one language.

These data were collected by then grad student Myriam Lapierre (Panara) and her RAs (English), and the analyses in these notebooks contributed to 
minimally a PhD thesis and [a proceedings paper](https://assta.org/proceedings/ICPhS2019/papers/ICPhS_359.pdf). The proceedings paper includes only 
identification (ID) experiment data, presented only to Panara speakers due to the nature of the task.
